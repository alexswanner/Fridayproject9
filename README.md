To run this program, you need to install both the .env file and the fridayproject9.py file. In the .env file you need to insert your own API key.

While working with the OpenAI API, I encountered several issues related to version compatibility and deprecated models. First, I received an error indicating that the openai.completion endpoint was no longer supported in OpenAI version 1.0.0 or higher. To resolve this, I downgraded the OpenAI Python library to version 0.28 using the command pip install openai==0.28. Additionally, I ran into an issue with the model text-davinci-003, which was deprecated. To fix this, I switched to a supported model like gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 instead. Lastly, I encountered an error stating that the v1/completions endpoint is not compatible with chat models. The solution was to use the correct endpoint for chat models: v1/chat/completions. These steps allowed me to resolve the errors and get the application working smoothly.

^^ This is all true but chat gpt definitely wrote that.
